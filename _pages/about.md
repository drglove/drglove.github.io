Thanks for visiting my blog! I work as a software developer at Metalhead Software on the Super Mega Baseball franchise, and have a bunch of side projects (both in-progress and abandoned.) Most of these posts will be technical in nature, and will vary from game development, to IT infrastructure, with the occasional recipe or whatever-I-feel-like thrown in.
