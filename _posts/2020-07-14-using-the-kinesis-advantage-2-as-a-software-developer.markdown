Firstly, this post will serve as my 'Hello, World!' blog post here. So if you're reading this, hello!

I recently picked up a [Kinesis Advantage 2][kinesis-kb] keyboard to ensure that my career as a software engineer won't be cut short by my wrists.

So far, I've used it for about one month and am relatively comfortable with it.
There is less strain on my wrists, and they sit at a good width with respect to my shoulders.
My typing speed is steadily increasing with practice, and it seems like it's doing the trick when writing prose.

However, most of my keyboard use is either for programming C++ with Visual Studio and [ViEmu][vi-emu] (I can't live without Vim-emulation), or playing games like Dota 2.
Let's ignore the gaming side for now, and focus on the more productive side of my life.

C++ uses it's fair share of special characters, as most programming languages tend to. This has been a sticking point with me and this keyboard, and I have not found a good solution so far.
It simply does not seem to be well designed for typing special characters.
Notably, any braces like `{}`, `[]`, and `<>` are quite awkward to type.
I tend to type more curly braces than boxy braces, so I've remapped the Kinesis to not require `Shift` for the former, and instead for the latter.
They still are very far down below my right pinky/ring finger, which makes them awkward to use.
One option might be to axe something like `Page Up/Down` on the thumb cluster on the right and replace with `{}` and `[]`.
If anyone has any advice for alternative layouts for these characters, please drop me an email.

Vim and this keyboard go together quite well, and it has been mostly painless aside from having to un-learn a few bad habits of mine.
Most notably, I tend to type `^` with my left-hand, which is now on the wrong side of the split keyboard, so I very regularly type `%` instead by accident.
The sorest point I've had to deal with so far however, is the strange nature of `hjkl` being used for navigation.
It didn't strike me as odd before, but why not `jkl;` instead? When I'm navigating on a "regular" keyboard, I find that I'm sliding my fingers over one key to accomdate for this, but this is effectively not doable on the Kinesis keyboard.
My fingers are getting used to stretching over to `h` instead now though, instead of repositioning my entire hand.
One thing that slightly helps here is remapping the up and down arrow keys by swapping them, since `jk` is `down/up`, but the Kinesis puts &#8593;/&#8595; beside each other.
Also, using `hjkl` is a bit of a crutch for navigating in Vim anyway, and as I become more comfortable with it (I'm still learning things even after 8 years of use), more movements take their place anyway.
And as always, you must remap `CAPSLOCK` to `Esc` as usual, especially on this keyboard since `Esc` is small and very out of the way.

Overall, I'm liking this keyboard, and am willing to put in the effort to make it the main keyboard I use everyday.
It's powerful, and comfortable, but has some flaws that need to be fixed in my case by tweaking the layout.

Just don't expect anyone else to be able to use your computer ever again.
